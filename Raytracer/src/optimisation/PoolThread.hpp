 * @brief A thread pool for managing and executing tasks concurrently
 * This class implements a thread pool that allows for the concurrent execution of tasks. It manages a queue of tasks and a pool of worker threads that continuously check for and execute tasks from the queue. The thread pool can be used to efficiently manage and execute multiple tasks in parallel, improving performance in scenarios where tasks can be executed concurrently, such as rendering pixels in a ray tracing application.
 * The PoolThread class provides methods for adding tasks to the queue and ensures proper synchronization between threads when accessing the task queue. It also handles graceful shutdown of the worker threads when the pool is destroyed.
